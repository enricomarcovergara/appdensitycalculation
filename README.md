## Explanations for Detailed Calculations

### Problem #3: Barangay Density
**Solving this problem involved the following steps:**
1. Counting the number of barangays in a given region
2. Given the area per region, the average area per barangay in a region is computed as follows: 
> Ave. Brgy Area in Region i= (Region i Area)/(Number of Barangays in Region i)
3. Calculating the population density by dividing the population per barangay by applying the following formula:
> Population Density per Barangay = (Total Number of Population per barangay) / (Ave. Brgy Area in Region i)
4. Listing the population density in descending order to get the top 5 barangays with the highest densities


### Problem #4: City Density
**Solving this problem involved the following steps:**
1. Counting the number of cities in a given region 
2. Given the area per region, the average area per city in a region is computed as follows: 
> Ave. City Area in Region i= (Region i Area)/(Number of Cities in Region i)
4. Calculating the total population per city
5. Calculating the population density by dividing the population per city by applying the following formula:
> Population Density per City = (Total Number of Population per city) / (Ave. City Area in Region i) 
6. Listing the population density in descending order to view the top 5 cities with the highest densities
